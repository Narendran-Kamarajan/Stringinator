I want to extract only the Alpha-Numeric characters avoiding all the special characters and whitespaces.
re module would be used to extract the characters, I got the function from https://www.journaldev.com/46322/extract-characters-alphanumeric-python-string

I have update the function to check the count of each alphanumberic character and populate the list of most repeated charcters.
